Implementation of Style-Transfer based on the original paper 'A neural algorithm of artistic style'.
As stated by the authors, style-transfer is 'an artificial system based on a Deep Neural Network
that creates artistic images of high perceptual quality'. In this work we aimed to replicate the 
original paper in a Pytorch-based implementation using as backbone a VGG-19 model. The results
present how the implementation is capable to transfer the desired content and style to a different 
image and even create an aesthetic result from scratch. 

This work was locally deployed using docker-compose and web sockets in order the create a
seamlessly implementation of style-transfer with an intuitive GUI.
